# Workshop: Knative on Minikube

This workshop is an adaptation of the [Knative Hands-on Workshop](https://harald-u.github.io/knative-handson-workshop/) I created for IBM.

The IBM Workshop uses preprovisioned Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters on the IBM Cloud based on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) or Red OpenShift on IBM Cloud.

This version of the workshop is based on [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) running on your own workstation.
